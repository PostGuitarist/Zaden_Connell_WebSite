        <h3>Experience Summary</h3>
        <p>4 years as a youth technolgoy intern, serving 1 year as the Assistant Director to live A/V Production and technology at local church. Included the creation of a program for an automated broadast setup, and the installation of new technology. Trained and lead 10+ volunteers to work with the production and technology team.

        <h3>My Percieved Calling</h3>
        <p>I believe God is calling me to serve as a Software Engineer at a company that values Christian values, such as Life.Church. Serving at a local church to create programs to help others has lead to a passion to create programs and designs for different needs. There are many Christian companies needing such help to further the Gospel in unreached places.</p>
